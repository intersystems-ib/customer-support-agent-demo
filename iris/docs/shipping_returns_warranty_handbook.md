# Shipping, Returns & Warranty Handbook

This handbook explains how shipping works, what each tracking status means, how to start a return, and what warranty coverage includes. It’s written for customers and support agents, with clear steps and examples.

## 1) Shipping Overview

- **Carriers we use:** DHL, UPS, FedEx (others may appear depending on destination).
- **Dispatch time:** Most orders ship within **24–48 hours** on business days.
- **Tracking code format:** Shared by email once a label is created. You can paste it into our tracker or the carrier’s website.
- **ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival):** Calculated by the carrier; weekends/holidays may extend delivery dates.

### 1.1 Common tracking statuses (canonical)
- **PreTransit** — Label created; package not yet in carrier network.
- **InTransit** — Moving between facilities; may include customs transit.
- **OutForDelivery** — On a local vehicle today.
- **Delivered** — Package delivered to the destination address (or reception/locker).
- **Exception** — An issue occurred (address, weather, customs, damage, lost, etc.).

> Tip: It’s normal to see no scans for ~24h after **PreTransit**. Scans resume once the first facility intake happens.

### 1.2 Where to check tracking
- **Our tracker:** Works with any carrier code we support.
- **Carrier site:** Use the code directly (e.g., “1Z” codes for UPS).

## 2) Troubleshooting Shipping

### 2.1 Delayed or stuck **InTransit**
1. Check the last scan timestamp and location.
2. If no movement for **72 hours**, contact support; we’ll open a carrier trace.
3. For international shipments, allow extra time for **customs**.

### 2.2 Marked **Delivered** but not received
1. Look around: porches, mail rooms, neighbors, building reception.
2. Check if someone else signed for it.
3. Wait **24 hours**—some carriers scan *before* the route finishes.
4. If still missing, contact support; we’ll verify GPS/driver notes and request a **proof of delivery**.

### 2.3 Address issues (**Exception**)
- If the carrier flags an address problem, contact support with:
  - Tracking code
  - Corrected address
  - Best phone/email
- We’ll submit an **address correction** or reroute if allowed.

### 2.4 Damaged packages
- Take clear photos of the **box and product**.
- Keep all packaging.
- Contact support within **7 days** of delivery so we can file a **damage claim** and arrange a replacement.
